Each PR gets its own preview URL like `pr-123.staging.plebeian.market`.\n\ncc @EdiWeeks @ChiefmonkeyArt @woikos \n\n## Problem\n\nCurrently, reviewing PRs requires:\n1. Checking out the branch locally\n2. Installing dependencies\n3. Running the dev server\n4. Testing manually\n\nThis creates friction for:\n- **Product owners** reviewing UX changes\n- **UI testers** validating visual updates\n- **Contributors** on \"help wanted\" issues who need feedback before investing more time\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Something like this anyway**\n\n### Architecture\n- **Wildcard DNS**: `*.staging.plebeian.market → 176.58.119.108` (one-time setup)\n- **Docker containers**: Each PR runs in isolated container on unique port\n- **nginx**: Routes subdomains to containers dynamically\n- **GitHub Actions**: Manual trigger to deploy, auto-cleanup on merge\n\n### URL Format\n```\npr-{number}.staging.plebeian.market\n```\nExample: `pr-462.staging.plebeian.market`\n\n### Workflow\n1. Reviewer clicks \"Run workflow\" on the deploy-preview action\n2. Enters PR number\n3. GitHub Action builds and deploys to a slot\n4. Bot comments on PR with preview URL\n5. On PR merge/close, slot is automatically cleaned up\n\n### Slot Management\n- **Manually triggered** to control resource usage\n- **Maximum 5 concurrent slots** (configurable)\n- Port assignment: PR number + 3000 (e.g., PR #123 → port 3123)\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Faster reviews**: Click a link instead of local setup\n- **Better for \"help wanted\" issues**: External contributors get quick UX feedback\n- **Product owner friendly**: Non-technical reviewers can test directly\n- **Consistent environment**: Same as staging, no \"works on my machine\" issues\n\n## One-time Setup Required\n\n1. Add wildcard DNS at DreamHost: `*.staging.plebeian.market`\n2. Install Docker on Linode (if not present)\n3. Configure nginx for dynamic subdomain routing\n4. Create GitHub workflow files\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n- [ ] Add wildcard DNS record\n- [ ] Set up Docker on Linode server\n- [ ] Create nginx wildcard config template\n- [ ] Create `deploy-preview.yml` workflow\n- [ ] Create `cleanup-preview.yml` workflow (on PR close)\n- [ ] Add PR comment bot for preview URLs\n- [ ] Document usage in CONTRIBUTING.md","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"woikos@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T10:27:53.715785576+01:00","created_by":"woikos","updated_at":"2026-01-27T10:27:53.715785576+01:00"}

This means:\n- Shop name = Personal name\n- Shop banner = Personal banner\n- Shop location = Personal location\n- Shop description = Personal about section\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAllow merchants to configure a separate \"shop profile\" that overrides or supplements their personal nPub profile for marketplace purposes. This could include:\n- Shop name / Display name\n- Shop banner image\n- Shop description / About\n- Shop location\n- Shop avatar/logo\n- Business contact information\n\n## Benefits\n\nThis aligns with NIP-15 (Nostr Marketplace) design philosophy where a merchant identity can be distinct from a personal identity. Benefits include:\n- Professional branding separate from personal profile\n- Privacy - merchants may not want to share personal info\n- Multiple storefronts from one nPub\n- Better organization for users who have both personal and business presence on Nostr\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n- Could use a marketplace-specific kind event for shop profiles\n- Or use tags on the user's profile to indicate marketplace-specific overrides\n- Should be backwards compatible - fallback to nPub profile if no shop profile exists","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"woikos@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T10:27:54.314670117+01:00","created_by":"woikos","updated_at":"2026-01-27T10:27:54.314670117+01:00"}
